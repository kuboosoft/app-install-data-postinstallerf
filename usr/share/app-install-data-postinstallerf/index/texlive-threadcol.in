The package combines a documents columns into a PDF "article
thread". PDF readers that support this mechanism (probably
Adobe Acrobat/Reader only) can be instructed to scroll
automatically from column to column, which facilitates on-
screen reading of two-column documents. Even for single-column
documents, threadcol supports the creation of multiple article
threads, which help organize discontiguous but logically
related regions of text into a form that the user can scroll
through as if its contents were contiguous.
