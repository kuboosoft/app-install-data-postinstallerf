The csvtools package allows you to repeatedly perform a set of
LaTeX commands on data in each row of a comma separated
variable (CSV) file (though substitution of the comma is
permitted). Such files may be used as source for mail merging,
generating tables etc. Examples are given in the documentation.
The distribution also provides packages csvsort, that provides
analagous commands to those in the main package, having first
sorted the data (using the xfor and compare packages); and
csvpie, for creating a pie-chart from a CSV file. The bundle
has now been superseded by the datatool bundle.
