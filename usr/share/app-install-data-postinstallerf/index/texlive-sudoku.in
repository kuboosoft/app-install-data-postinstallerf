The sudoku package provides an environment for typesetting
sudoku grids. A sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid where some of the
squares in the grid contain numbers. The rules are simple
every column can only contain the digits 1 to 9, every row can
only contain the digits 1 to 9 and every 3x3 box can only
contain the digits 1 to 9. More information, including help and
example puzzles, can be found at sudoku.org.uk. This site also
has blank sudoku grids (or worksheets), but you will not need
to print them from there if you have this package installed.
