Writer2LaTeX is a utility written in java. It converts LibreOffice documents
? in particular documents containing formulas ? into other formats. It is
actually a collection of four converters, i.e.
1) Writer2LaTeX converts documents into LaTeX 2e format for high quality
   typesetting.
2) Writer2BibTeX extracts bibliographic data from a document and stores it in
   BibTeX format (works together with Writer2LaTeX).
3) Writer2xhtml converts documents into XHTML 1.0 or XHTML 1.1+MathML 2.0 with
   CSS2.
4) Calc2xhtml is a companion to Writer2xhtml that converts OOo Calc documents
