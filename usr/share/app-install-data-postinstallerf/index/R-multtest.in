Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing
procedures for controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized
family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of
false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR). Single-step and
step-wise methods are implemented. Tests based on a variety of t- and
F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression parameters from
linear and survival models) are included. Results are reported in terms
of adjusted p-values, confindence regions and test statistic cutoffs.
The procedures are directly applicable to identifying differentially
expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.
