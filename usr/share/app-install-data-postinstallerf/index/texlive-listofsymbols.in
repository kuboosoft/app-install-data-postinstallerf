Listofsymbols provides commands to automatically create a list
of symbols (also called notation or nomenclature), and to
handle symbols logically, i.e. define a macro that is expanded
to the desired output and use the macro in the text rather than
`hardcoding the output into the text. This helps to ensure
consistency throughout the text, especially if there is a
chance that symbols will be changed at some stage. The package
is more or less a combination of what the packages nomencl and
formula do. The concept of creating the list of symbols,
though, is different from the way nomencl.sty does it.
