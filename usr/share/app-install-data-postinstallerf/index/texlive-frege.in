The package defines a number of new commands for typesetting
fregean Begriffsschrift in LaTeX. It is loosely based on the
package begriff, and offers a number of improvements including
better relative lengths of the content stroke with respect to
other strokes, content strokes that point at the middle of
lines rather than the bottom, a greater width for the assertion
stroke as compared to the content stroke, a more intuitive
structure for the conditional, greater care taken to allow for
the linewidth in the spacing of formulas.
