This is a beta-release of the font, though it is believed to be
largely usable. (The author retains the right to make
incompatible changes in the future.) The font covers the Arabic
and Arabic Supplement blocks of Unicode 6.0, which means it
essentially covers any language written in Arabic script and
supported by Unicode.
