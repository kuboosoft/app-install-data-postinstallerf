The file can be used to format the bibliographies of PhD
theses, books etc., according to the latest Russian standards
GOST 7.82 - 2001 and GOST 7.1 - 2003. It introduces the minimum
number of new entries and styles to cover all frequently used
situations. The style file provides an easy way to perform a
semiautomatic, or a completely manual sort of the list of the
references. Processing bibliographies produced by the style
requires a 8-bit BibTeX system.
