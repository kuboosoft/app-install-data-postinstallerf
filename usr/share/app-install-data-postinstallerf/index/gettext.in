The GNU gettext package provides a set of tools and documentation for
producing multi-lingual messages in programs. Tools include a set of
conventions about how programs should be written to support message
catalogs, a directory and file naming organization for the message
catalogs, a runtime library which supports the retrieval of translated
messages, and stand-alone programs for handling the translatable and
the already translated strings. Gettext provides an easy to use
library and tools for creating, using, and modifying natural language
catalogs and is a powerful and simple method for internationalizing
programs.
