Comment3='
This package enables (La)TeX users to typeset words or phrases
(e-tex extensions are needed) in Syriac (Aramaic) using the
Serto-alphabet. The package includes a preprocessor written in
Python (>= 1.5.2) in order to deal with right-to-left
typesetting for those who do not want to use elatex and to
choose the correct letter depending on word context
(initial/medial/final form). Detailed documentation and
examples are included.
