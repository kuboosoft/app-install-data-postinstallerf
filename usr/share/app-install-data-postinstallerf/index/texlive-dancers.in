The (Sherlock Holmes) book contains a code which uses dancing
men as glyphs. The alphabet as given is not complete, lacking
f, j, k, q, u, w, x and z, so those letters in the font are not
due to Conan Doyle. The code required word endings to be marked
by the dancing man representing the last letter to be holding a
flag these are coded as A-Z.

man has no arms, making it impossible for him to hold a flag.
In these cases, he is wearing a flag on his hat in the
character. The font is distributed as MetaFont source.
